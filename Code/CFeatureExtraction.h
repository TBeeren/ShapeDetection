 * @brief CFeature extraction is responsible for extracting features from input Matrixes. It does this primarily by applying an inRange mask for the specified colour,
 * afterwards Canny edge detection is applied to gather edges. These edges are used to determine the corner points for each shape that has the specified colout.
